# Programming and Scripting project 2021

## Introduction
The repository is created to show my research of the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set and to write the documentation for my python code to investigate.  The first objective is to create a README file which contains a summary of the dataset and investigation. 

1.	Fisher’s Iris data set background

## The Fisher’s Iris data set background
### Ronald Fisher
Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, byname R.A. Fisher, (born February 17, 1890, London, England—died July 29, 1962, Adelaide, Australia), British statistician and geneticist who pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments. [1]

### The data set
Dr E. Anderson measured the two species Iris setosa and iris versicolor growing in the same colony with the third sample Iris virginica, differs from the two other samples in not being taken from the same natural colony [2]. The dataset fifty samples of each of the three Iris’s, with four measurements dimensions in each of the three different Iris’s
1.	Sepal Length
2.	Sepal width
3.	Petal Length
4.	Petal width

The dataset was first used by Ronald Fisher in 1936 in his paper “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”. The idea proposed by Fisher is linear discriminant: “WHEN two or more populations have been measured in several characters, xl, ... , x8, special interest attaches to certain linear  functions of the measurements  by which the populations are best discriminated.” [2]
